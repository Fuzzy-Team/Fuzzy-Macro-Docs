# Running the Macro

Before you start the macro, make sure you have done the following things:

* Make sure Roblox is in full-screen when running the macro
* Make sure to disconnect any external monitors. They _may_ not work with the macro (only applies to laptops)
* Claim a hive before starting the macro

**IMPORTANT:** The `run_macro.command` The file has to stay in the macro folder. Moving it outside the folder will cause the macro to break.

#### Errors when opening the macro

There are mainly two different errors:

**Error: Unidentified Developer**

To fix this, right click `run_macro.command` and press Open.

**Error: Could not verify it is free of malware**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2)>)
